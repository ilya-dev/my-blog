# My Blog

I will be developing this project in "live" mode. Here is what I plan to do:

## Back-end

+ I will use **PHP >= 5.5.0**, it's time.
+ I will use **Laravel**, freaking love it!
+ I will stick with **SQLite**, no caching (as I don't really need it).
+ I will leverage the **Markdown format** and one of its parsers (eh, **Parsedown**?).

## Front-end

+ I will use **Twitter Bootstrap**, that's for sure.
+ I plan to stick with plain **Jquery**, but I may make a switch to **Angular**.
+ I will use CDNs, because I don't think it's a good idea to store this stuff locally.
+ I will try to move as much logic as possible to the back-end.
